2d Array Assignment

1. Write a program to add two matrices and save the result in one of the given matrices.
    Input 1:
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9

    4 5 8
    0 0 8
    1 2 0
    Output 1:
    5 7 11
    4 5 14
    8 10 9

2. Q1: Write a program to store 10 at every index of a 2D matrix with 5 rows and 5 columns

3. Q3: Given a matrix ‘A’ of dimension n x m and 2 coordinates (l1, r1) and (l2, r2). Return the sum of the
    rectangle from (l1,r1) to (l2, r2).
    Input 1:
    1 2 -3 4
    0 0 -4 2
    1 -1 2 3
    -4 -5 -7 0
    l1 = 1, r1 = 2 , l2 = 3 , r2 = 3
    Output 1: -4
